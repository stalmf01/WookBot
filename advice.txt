You just need to cheer up! :smile:
Don't be sad. :sad:
It's okay you're not special. :blush:
There are plenty of fish in the sea, and twice as much trash. :grimace:
Just don't worry about it!
Once you know what you want just wait until it comes your way!
You're not useless... Just not very useful. :wink:
Depressed? Don't be!
Life is like a roller coaster and you're still in line for it.
