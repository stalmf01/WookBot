You just need to cheer up! :smile:
Don't be sad. :sad:
It's okay you're not special. :blush:
There are plenty of fish in the sea, and twice as much trash. :grimace:
Just don't worry about it!
Once you know what you want just wait until it comes your way!
You're not useless... Just not very useful. :wink:
Depressed? Don't be! :smile:
Life is like a roller coaster and you're still in line for it.
If you ever think about the amount of people there are on Earth, you start to realize how insignificant you really are!
Look up at the stars and pick one! And then forget about it because you'll probably never find it again.
It's okay to move on. Nothing is waiting for you anyways. :heart:
